# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview 
FastLending, a peer to peer lending service, wants to use machine learning to build models that predict credit risk. They want to use these models to provide a quicker and more accurate service for customers. They also beleive that machine learning will help find best qualified candidiates and lower defualt rates.

* The accuracy score is 71%, which is a good range to be in as it is not too accurate (overfit), but accurate enough to be a reliable model. 
* However, when we look at the confusion matrix, we can see that the majority of the accuracey seems to work only for predicting 1 (or low risk) but not 0 (or high risk). This indicates that  this model would accurate but not percise. 
* If you look at the classification report, my point is further proved by the incredibly low precision score for 0 (high risk) loa status', and the perfect precision score for 1 (low risk). 
* This model would not be useful in rooting out high risk applicants.
